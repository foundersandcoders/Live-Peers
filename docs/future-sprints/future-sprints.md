# Beyond this sprint:

**Features:**
+ Add subtitles to audio (This particular accessibility concern is unfortunately outside the scope of the first two week sprint)
+ Preserving live content - copy & paste-able code / docs.
  + Not just a screencast of the presenter's text editor, but a hackpad-style / figma-style multiple author capability
  + Read-only version i.e. include admin rights
+ Additions to text service
  + incorporate markdown syntax and is linkable to github repos and issues
  + turn messages into Q&A format
  + allow two users to chat privately
+ Voting service
+ Record metrics e.g. number of attendees - could be used to pitch idea for funding

**UX concerns:**  
+ Displaying high definition presentation materials (screen cast) at the same time as presenter video/audio. Choose between:
  + Ordinary camera shot of everything at once
  + Two tabs - one with the presenter in the room, another with the slides/code
  + Display both on one tab: one half of screen for presenter, one half for slides/code
  + Full screen cast with audio overlay
