# Live-Peers

## VISION

Enable real-time, peer-to-peer participation and sharing of content.

### Relevant scenarios in FAC
+ Presentations from external speakers
+ Project show & tells, whether this is from alumni or students
+ Workshops - during curriculum from internal mentors
+ Code alongs
+ Sharing internal mentoring sessions
+ Business meetings

#### Problems
Sharing presentations/workshops (across campuses)

Enabling participation:
+ Q & A - Can't put your hand up and be noticed by the presenter/mentor if you're not physically in the room
+ Voting - Coming through text chat makes it difficult to count
+ Screen Sharing - Presentations and code alongs - don't have any control over which tab/window the presenter is on or whether they are going to fast for you

## SPRINT 1
**Problem**: Sharing presentation content

**Content to include:** Presenters' audio, video & screencast.

**Necessary feature:** Request authentication for the creation of a room & joining a room

**UX/UI concerns:** Displaying high definition presentation materials (screen cast) at the same time as presenter video/audio:
+ Half / half screen - presenter on one side, slides/code on the other side
+ Audio overlay to full screen cast + subtitles (This particular accessibility concern is unfortunately outside the scope of these two weeks)

### Stretch goals
**Problem**: Participation
1. Text service for participants:
  + Write a piece of text that everyone else can see
  + Names being attached to messages
2. Level of authentication - determine identity of:
  + Presenter
  + Participant(s)

## Beyond this sprint:
+ Preserving live content - copy & paste-able code / docs.
  + Not just a screencast of the presenter's text editor, but a hackpad-style / figma-style multiple author capability
  + Read-only version i.e. include admin rights
+ Additions to text service
  + incorporate markdown syntax and is linkable to github repos and issues
  + turn messages into Q&A format
+ Voting service
+ Record metrics e.g. number of attendees - could be used to pitch idea for funding
