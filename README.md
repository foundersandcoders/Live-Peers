## VISION

Enable real-time, peer-to-peer participation and sharing of content.

### Relevant scenarios in FAC
+ Presentations from mentors / external speakers
+ Project show & tells, whether this is from alumni or students
+ Workshops - during curriculum from internal mentors
+ Code alongs
+ Sharing internal mentoring sessions
+ Business meetings

#### Problems
Sharing presentations/workshops (across campuses)

Enabling participation:
+ Q & A - Can't put your hand up and be noticed by the presenter/mentor if you're not physically in the room
+ Voting - Coming through text chat makes it difficult to count
+ Screen Sharing - Presentations and code alongs - don't have any control over which tab/window the presenter is on or whether they are going to fast for you

## SPRINT 1

### Scenarios
+ Presentations from mentors / external speakers

(Useful for all other scenarios too, but no special functionality that would needed in those cases e.g. screencasting)

Head [here](docs/sprint1/sprint1.md) for details.

### Design
Check out these designs to have an idea of how we would ideally like LivePeers to look like. 

Here is the [invision link](https://invis.io/2HAKH3WCN), click the mockup to see how the flows works or check out the [Mockups folder](https://github.com/foundersandcoders/Live-Peers/tree/master/docs/sprint1/Mockups) in our repository to see the screen grabs of the designs.
