## VISION

Enable real-time, peer-to-peer participation and sharing of content.

### Relevant scenarios in FAC
+ Presentations from mentors / external speakers
+ Project show & tells, whether this is from alumni or students
+ Workshops - during curriculum from internal mentors
+ Code alongs
+ Sharing internal mentoring sessions
+ Business meetings

#### Problems
Sharing presentations/workshops (across campuses)

Enabling participation:
+ Q & A - Can't put your hand up and be noticed by the presenter/mentor if you're not physically in the room
+ Voting - Coming through text chat makes it difficult to count
+ Screen Sharing - Presentations and code alongs - don't have any control over which tab/window the presenter is on or whether they are going to fast for you

## SPRINT 1

### Scenarios
+ Presentations from mentors / external speakers

(Useful for all other scenarios too, but no special functionality that would needed in those cases e.g. screencasting)

### User journeys

**As a** mentor  
**I would like to** share my content (across campuses)  
**So that** paricipation is not limited by location

**As a** moderator  
**I would like to** access content and be able to share it  
**So that** those in my location can participate

**As a** student  
**I would like to** access remote content and share my own messages  
**So that** I can actively participate in the learning experience

For breakdown into user stories, see github issues.
